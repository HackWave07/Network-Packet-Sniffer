A Python-based network packet sniffer that captures and analyzes live network traffic to identify suspicious or anomalous behavior.
This project uses Scapy for low-level packet capture and includes a lightweight anomaly detection module that flags potential intrusions or abnormal traffic patterns.

🚀 Features

🧠 Real-time Packet Capture – Monitors live network traffic.

🔍 Protocol Analysis – Extracts details from TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP packets.

⚙️ Custom Filters – Filter traffic by IP address or protocol type.

🚨 Anomaly Detection – Detects unusual packet flow frequency using a flow-based detector.

📊 Wireshark-like Insights – Optional integration with PyShark for deeper inspection.

🧩 Modular Design – Easy to extend with custom detection rules.

🧰 Tech Stack

Language: Python 3

Libraries: Scapy, Netifaces, PyShark
